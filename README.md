# Sentry Gun 
Sentry gun is my first big python project. 
It's a stationary Raspberry Pi connected to the "Server" computer via Ethernet cable. It detects moving objects based on stationary image 
captured via CSI connector on Raspberry Pi. Based on the image Raspberry Pi tries to aim laser beacon controlled by servo motors on the moving object.
